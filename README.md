An exploration of the Model Conductor Hardware architecture and Test Driven Development in Embedded C .

## What does this code do?
We've created a modular embedded architecture that runs a reflex test game that can be used for interactive STEM displays. A simple display can allow educators to share simple principles about electrical engineering and computer science with young students. The Embedded Reflex Test highlights embedded systems, FPGAs, and good software development habits.

## What is this repository for?

We're learning the concepts of Test Driven Development for embedded systems by following the Model Conductor Hardware architecture established [here](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/628d552469d2a1b0c6b730a9/6348954fc668b446b040465c_EmbeddedFeatureDrivenDesignUsingTDDandMocksPaper.pdf). We'll be drawing from examples created by ThrowTheSwitch in [this](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/CMock) repo.

As a by product, we've created an extensible software architecture for a simple reflex test game that can be used for interactive STEM displays.
